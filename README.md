# Using Affordances to Improve the Content Strategy and Information Architecture

These worksheets intend to provide a walkthrough of how the cBR Information Architecture was deconstructed and then reconstructed, by using the idea of Affordances. The details of the worksheets are as follows:

## Phase 1: Identify and list the primary affordance

The Primary Affordance would be clear and evident from the product landing page, marketing collaterals, or even the Wikipedia page that you might get to, while doing a basic search. It could be a single feature, or even a group of features.

## Phase 2: Discern the Secondary and Diagnostic affordances

It might be difficult to discern the Secondary and Diagnostic affordances merely by reading through them. This process was fast tracked by listing out all of the technical literature into a series of excel sheets. The following information was captured:

•	Name of the Feature/Topic: Name by which the feature is listed in the product.
•	Introduced in Version	: In which release of the product was the feature released? This gives us an indication whether there might be a parent or child features that we might have missed.
•	Where is the topic currently in: Name of the current placeholder or the book where the feature is listed? 
•	What does the Feature do:  This captures a single line from the documentation, and speaks about what value add does the feature bring to the product.
•	Proposed/Alternate IA: Provide an alternate placeholder title, if the feature does not seem to belong to its current placeholder of book. This is a label that might continuously evolve, with iterative stakeholder reviews, and with our own understanding of the product.

This involved the following worksheets:

- 2a_cBR_BreakUpOfBooks.xlsx: This worksheet lists all of the Technical Communications Literature that pertains to the product, for a singular release. The books and their constituent topics are listed, column-wise.
- 2b_cBR_BreakUpOfBooks_Flagged.xlsx: This worksheet lists all of the topics, for every given book. The books and their constituent topics are listed, column-wise, and they topics that do not fit into the overall scheme of the books are flagged Red (confirmed) and Yellow (pending stakeholder reviews). An alternative placeholder parent is also suggested.
- 2c_cBR_BreakUpOfTopics.xlsx: This worksheet captures the Feature Names and its core function, Release Information, and existing parentage (current book placement). It also proposes an alternative IA placehilder for some of the topics.

## Phase 3: Identifying patterns

Through iterative reviews and discussions, we can notice subtle patterns emerging over subsequent reviews. We had color-coded some of these to reflect a broad theme. This involved the following worksheet:

 - 3a_cBR_BreakUpOfTopics_ColorCoded.xlsx: This worksheet captures the Feature Names and they are code-colored to denote the broad category function that they fall into.

## Phase 4: Finalizing the Content Strategy 

Eventually, with multiple reviews and stakeholder discussions, it becomes obvious that these broad themes denote new topic containers and choices that were not obvious earlier. This involved the following worksheet:

 - 4a_cBR_ClusteredAndRestructured.xlsx: This worksheet captures the new IA, and its various workflows. Pathways are provisioned to cater to the Primary Affordances (Provisioning Video), and subsequently, to the Secondary Affordances (Traffic Management and Enabling Security) and Diagnostic Affordances (Diagnostics).
